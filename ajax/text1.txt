The People's Park is near Dun Laoghaire town centre, between Glasthule and the Seafront.  It was developed by the then Kingstown Town Commissioners towards the end of the 19th century in the formal Victorian style. It was enclosed by wrought iron railings and gates with the most prominent entrances off George's Street and Queen's Road.
